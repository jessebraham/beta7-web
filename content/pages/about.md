Hello! My name is Jesse Braham, and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

I am currently employed as a Systems Developer. In this position I am responsible for developing and maintaining the software and infrastructure required to support embedded devices, which are usually built around cellular or satellite communications. My duties includes writing everything from web applications to firmware, as well as administrating servers. Occasionally I even get to tinker with electronics and other hardware.

I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, C#, C, Rust, and some others. I have experience working with frameworks such as Django, ASP.NET MVC, and Mithril, and have worked with various relational and NoSQL databases.

I have a multitude of interests, which include (but are not limited to) hardware design/embedded development, programming languages, systems programming (compilers, operating systems, etc.), automation & tooling, engineering & manufacturing, and physical simulations. Outside of tech I love comic books, music, astronomy & physics, and being outdoors.
