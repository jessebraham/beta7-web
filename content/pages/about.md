Title: About
Sort:  99


Employed as a Systems Developer since 2015. Currently residing in Kelowna, BC. Graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, holding a Diploma of Technology in Computer Systems Technology. The primary focus of my studies was in Data Communications and Internetworking.

My current position involves working mainly with embedded electronics, developing firmware (C/C++) and related infrastructure and services (C#.NET, JavaScript). These devices utilize satellite and cellular communication, as well as GPS and a number of other RF technologies. Ocassionally I review schematics and board layouts, or perform some hands-on work such as troubleshooting and repairing PCBs. I'm also responsible for a number networking, system administration and general IT tasks.

I am an advocate of Open Source Software, Net Neutrality and privacy in general. Most personal projects are developed in [Python](https://python.org/), although I dabble with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/), among many others. Software-related interests include Crypto Currency and Blockchains, Machine/Deep Learning, Devops, Security and Distributed Systems. I am also interested in Astronomy, various fields of Engineering, Math, Physics and probably some other things.

When I'm not writing code I enjoy being outdoors, listening to music, reading comics and playing video games. Occasionally I go out and do things with other humans.
