Title: About


Graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, holding a diploma in Computer Systems Technology with a focus on Data Communications and Internetworking. Currently employed as a Systems Developer in Kelowna, BC. 

My current employer specializes in custom embedded electronics utilizing satellite and cellular communications, GPS, and various other RF technologies. Products are generally intended for tracking, communications, and remote asset monitoring. My primary roles include developing supporting services and infrastructure, firmware development, and writing web applications; I also perform various networking and system administration tasks. Every once in awhile I get to play with some hardware, whether it be racking up a new server, prototyping a new circuit or performing analysis and repairs on a device.  

My language of choice is [Python](https://www.python.org/), however I also enjoy writing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) from time to time. Any embedded development is done in C/C++ or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Technical interests include (but are not limited to) distributed systems, deep learning, security, devops, and embedded/real-time systems. I'm an advocate of open-source software, net neutrality and data privacy. 

Other non-technical interests include astronomy/physics, math, and history. When I'm not writing code or doing research for a project, I enjoy reading comic books, gaming, and doing pretty much anything outdoors. Occasionally I go do things with other humans.
