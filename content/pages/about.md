Title: About
Sort:  99


I have been employed as a Systems Developer since 2015, and am currently residing in Kelowna, British Columbia. I am a graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, holding a Diploma of Technology in Computer Systems Technology. The primary focus of my studies was Data Communications and Internetworking.  

I work primarily with satellite and cellular communications, as well as GPS tracking. I develop firmware in C/C++ and system/web applications mostly in C#.NET and JavaScript.  

I'm a strong advocate of Open Source Software, Net Neutrality and Internet Privacy in general. Most personal projects are developed in [Python](https://python.org/), although I dabble with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) from time to time, among others. Software-related interests include Crypto Currency and Blockchains, Machine/Deep Learning, Devops and Concurrency/Scalability. I am also interested in Engineering, Math and Physics.  

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, reading comics and technical books, ocassionally watching television (mostly cartoons) and playing video games. Ocassionally I go outside and do things with other humans.
