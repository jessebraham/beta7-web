Title: About


Employed as a Systems Developer in Kelowna, BC. Graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, holding a diploma in Computer Systems Technology. The primary focus of my studies was in Data Communications and Inter-networking.  

My position involves working with embedded electronics utilizing satellite and cellular communications, GPS, and various other RF technologies. Our products generally perform tracking and asset monitoring, although they have a variety of unique applications. My primary roles include developing firmware (C/C++), related infrastructure and services (C#.NET) and web applications (JavaScript). I also perform various networking, system administration and general IT tasks. Sometimes I get to play with hardware and do some prototyping, evaluation, or perform troubleshooting and repairs.  

I am an advocate of [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), the open web and privacy in general. My language of choice is [Python](https://python.org/), but I also dabble with [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), among others. Software-related interests include (but are not limited to) Machine/Deep Learning, Devops, Security and Distributed Systems. I also enjoy studying Astronomy, Physics, Math, History and probably some other things.  

When I'm not writing code I enjoy listening to music, reading comics, gaming and being outdoors. I'm a self proclaimed maker, and enjoy working with my hands. Occasionally I go do things with other humans.
