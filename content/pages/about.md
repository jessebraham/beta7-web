Title: About
Sort:  99


Systems Developer since 2015, currently residing in Kelowna, British Columbia. I am a graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology, holding a Diploma of Technology in Computer Systems Technology. The primary focus of my studies was Data Communications and Inter-networking.

My current position involves working primarily with satellite and cellular communications, as well as GPS tracking. I develop firmware in C/C++ and system/web applications mostly in C#.NET and (reluctantly) JavaScript. Sometimes I do hands-on work with electronics; building up boards, troubleshooting and repairs, etc. I also perform some networking and general system administration tasks.

I am an advocate of Open Source Software, Net Neutrality and privacy in general. Most personal projects are developed in [Python](https://python.org/), although I dabble with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) from time to time, among many others. Software-related interests include Crypto Currency and Blockchains, Machine/Deep Learning, Devops and Distributed Systems. I am also interested in Astronomy, Engineering, Math and Physics.

When I'm not writing code I enjoy listening to music, reading comics and playing video games. Occasionally I go outside and do things with other humans.
